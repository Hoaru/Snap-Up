During the Black Five, some on-line shopping website would like to attract customers by selling some products at lower
prices. For example, the normal price of a iPhone 14 is $799, and some websites would like to sell 10 iPhone 14 for only
$499. At that point, it would lead to a problem that a large amount of purchasing request(> 100/RPS). Therefore, I
develope a website to solve this problem. Also, I used Docker + Jenkins + Git together for CI/CD.

Front End: HTML5 + CSS

Back End: Java

Tools& Framework: SpringBoot, MyBatis, MySQL, Apache JMeter, Redis, Docker, Jenkins, Git

I have finished 50% of this project.
