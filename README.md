During the Black Five, some on-line shopping website would like to attract customers by selling some products at lower prices.
For example, the normal price of a iPhone 14 is $799, and the merchants would like to sell 10 iPhone 14 for only $499.
At that point, it would lead to a problem that a large amount of purchasing request(> 200/RPS). In order to solve such problem,
I develope a web page to solve this problem.

Front End: HTML5 + CSS

Back End: Java

Tools: SpringBoot, MyBatis, Redis, MySQL, Apache JMeter

I have finished 50% of this project.
